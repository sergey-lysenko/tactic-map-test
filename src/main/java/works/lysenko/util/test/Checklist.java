/**
 * The Checklist class provides a sequence of operations to verify and update
 * grid data through preflight checks. It implements the Runnable interface,
 * enabling its execution within a thread.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to coordinate and orchestrate the following tasks:
 * - Calculate the maximum polychromies across grid files.
 * - VerifyResource the correctness of redefined color amounts in grid data.
 * - Check for undefined color references within grid files.
 * <p>
 * Each operation is executed in a specific sequence to ensure data integrity
 * and highlight any inconsistencies or errors in the grid definitions.

    /**
     * Executes a sequence of preflight operations for verifying and updating grid data.
     * <p>
     * This method coordinates the following operations:
     * <p>
     * 1. `calculateMaxPolychromies`: Calculates the maximum polychromies by processing all
     *    grid files in a designated directory. This includes identifying `.grid` files,
     *    calculating polychromy values for each, and handling potential F/T exceptions.
     * <p>
     * 2. `verifyRedefinedAmounts`: Verifies the correctness of redefined color amounts for
     *    specified grid files. This includes validation of redefinitions and reporting
     *    results in titled sections of the execution output while managing file access errors.
     * <p>
     * 3. `verifyUndefinedColours`: Checks for undefined color references in grid files. It
     *    identifies discrepancies in the color definitions, logs unknown colors, and manages
     *    exceptions during the validation process.
     * <p>
     * This method ensures the preflight status of the grid data by aggregating the results
     * from each of the above steps and handling any issues that arise during their execution.
